- get-services.ts, get-users.ts, get-workers.ts
- toggle-service-status.ts, toggle-worker-status.ts
- upsert-appointments.ts, upsert-service.ts, upsert-worker.ts

UI Components removed:

- form.tsx, progress.tsx, scroll-area.tsx, sheet.tsx, table.tsx, textarea.tsx

Lib files removed:
- auth.ts, plan-limits.ts, session.ts, subscription.ts

Updated:
- layout.tsx: removed unused imports and simplified structure for admin panel
- metadata: updated title to "CorteZapp Admin" and description

Final structure:
- Clean admin panel with only necessary files for managing gestores
- Only essential UI components kept (alert, avatar, badge, button, card, checkbox, dialog, dropdown-menu, input, label, popover, select)
- Core functionality: admin authentication, gestor CRUD, admin dashboard
- Reduced project size and complexity significantly

Result: Lean admin panel focused only on administrative functions
